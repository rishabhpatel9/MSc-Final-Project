This is a gender classification model that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of faces as male or female. The model is trained on a dataset of face images and their corresponding gender labels. The notebook includes code for data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation which will then be used for algorithmic bias detection.
